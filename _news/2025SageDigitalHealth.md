{Placeholder: I submitted a manuscript to SAGE Digital Health special issue ["Innovations and Applications of Synthetic Data in Transforming Healthcare Systems: Opportunities, Challenges and Ethical Considerations
"](https://journals.sagepub.com/topic/collections-dhj/dhj-1_sythetic_data_in_transforming_healthcare/dhj) for the first time, and the work is derived from my Honours thesis ([SHIELD]() framework)!}
