It contrasts this with Glicko’s introduction of <strong>rating deviation (RD)</strong> and update dynamics (constant (c), RD bounds), showing how uncertainty and game volume affect rating adjustments.</p> <p><strong>Highlights</strong></p> <ul> <li>Derives intersection area of two normal distributions to interpret draw likelihood at a given rating gap.</li> <li>Recasts Elo expected score into logistic form (E_A = \frac{1}{1+10^{(R_B-R_A)/400}}).</li> <li>Explains Glicko’s RD, its growth via constant (c), and how RD contracts with recent results, yielding more responsive ratings.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>Word count: ~3990, excluding tables/appendices with game data (3-min, 10-min formats).</p> </blockquote> </body></html>
